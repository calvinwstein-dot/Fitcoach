# 🎵 Audio Queue Management - Overlapping Fixed

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### ❌ Before (Overlapping Audio):
- Each voice prompt created a **new HTML5 Audio element**
- **No stopping** of previous audio
- **Multiple prompts played simultaneously**
- **Audio chaos** when clicking buttons quickly

### ✅ After (Sequential Audio):
- **Single audio element tracking** with `_currentAudio`
- **Previous audio stopped** before new audio starts
- **Clean audio management** with proper cleanup
- **One prompt at a time** - no overlapping

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Audio Management Added:
```dart
html.AudioElement? _currentAudio; // Track current audio

// In _speak() function:
// 1. Stop previous audio
if (_currentAudio != null) {
  _currentAudio!.pause();
  _currentAudio!.currentTime = 0;
}

// 2. Create new audio and store reference
_currentAudio = audioElement;

// 3. Clean up when audio ends
audioElement.onEnded.listen((_) {
  if (_currentAudio == audioElement) {
    _currentAudio = null;
  }
});
```

### Testing Steps:
1. **Open the app** and go to Settings
2. **Click multiple voice test buttons quickly**
3. **Expected behavior:**
   - ✅ **Previous audio stops** when new button clicked
   - ✅ **Only one voice plays** at a time
   - ✅ **Console shows:** `🛑 Stopped previous audio`
   - ✅ **Clean audio transitions**

### Console Messages to Look For:
```
🛑 Stopped previous audio
🔊 HTML5 Audio Only - Attempting TTS: https://...
🎵 HTML5: Can play
🎵 HTML5: Ended
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

### ❌ Old Behavior:
- Click 3 buttons quickly → 3 voices talking over each other
- Audio chaos and confusion
- No way to stop overlapping audio

### ✅ New Behavior:
- Click 3 buttons quickly → Only the last voice plays
- Previous voices are stopped cleanly
- One clear voice at a time
